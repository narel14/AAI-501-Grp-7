# AAI 501 - Final Team Project

This repository contains the work for the final team project for the AAI 501 course. The project involves identifying an AI-driven problem, performing a hands-on analysis using machine learning techniques, and delivering a comprehensive report and presentation.

## Project Description

**(Team to complete this section)**

A brief, one-paragraph summary of the project. This should include:

  * **Problem Statement:** A clear and unambiguous statement of the problem you are solving.
  * **Business Application:** The real-world organizational or business application of your project.
  * **Goals:** What you aim to achieve (e.g., predict loan defaults with \>90% accuracy, classify human activities, identify key features for predicting malignancy).
  * **Course Topics:** Identification of specific course topics applied (e.g., Classification, Clustering, Deep Learning, NLP, etc.).

## Team Members üë•

## Dataset üìä

**(Team to complete this section)**

  * **Dataset Name:** [e.g., UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones]
  * **Source:** [Provide a link to the dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository]
  * **Description:** A brief overview of the dataset, including its size (instances and features), and what the data represents.

**Note:** Per project requirements, the selected dataset must contain **more than 1000 examples** and should not require excessive data preprocessing.

## Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

**(Team to complete this section)**

This project will investigate a solution by applying and comparing **at least two different types of machine learning algorithms** (e.g., Classification, Clustering, Regression).

Our experimental design includes:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** [Briefly describe steps, e.g., handling missing values, scaling features].
2.  **Feature Engineering/Selection:** [Briefly describe steps, e.g., creating new features, using PCA or feature importance].
3.  **Model Training:** We will train the following models:
      * **Model 1:** [e.g., Logistic Regression]
      * **Model 2:** [e.g., Random Forest Classifier]
      * *(Add more if applicable)*
4.  **Model Evaluation & Comparison:** We will compare the models based on metrics such as [e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC]. Results will be presented graphically to showcase performance differences.
