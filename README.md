# Strategic Planning of Cycling Infrastructure Through Built Environment Analysis and Network Optimization

**Course:** AAI 501 Final Project  
**Team:** Group 7 (Marston Ward, Nelson Arellano)

## 1. Project Overview

This project develops a data-driven system to aid city planners in the strategic development of bike paths. Our approach focuses on identifying and addressing "bike lane deserts"â€”urban areas with high potential for bicycle use but lacking safe, connected cycling routes. By analyzing the built environment and applying network optimization algorithms, the system proposes high-impact infrastructure additions to enhance urban micro-mobility.

## 2. Problem Statement

Cycling adoption varies dramatically across cities and is heavily influenced by the quality of infrastructure. While cities like Copenhagen have achieved over 50% bicycle commuting, adoption in the United States remains in the low single digits. This project addresses the challenge of intelligently expanding cycling networks to make biking a safer and more viable transportation option.

## 3. Project Objectives

The system is designed to function as an "infrastructure planner" that will:

1. **Diagnose** current cycling infrastructure to identify underserved areas.
2. **Analyze** the urban environment using objective, data-driven clustering methods.
3. **Propose** strategic new bike lanes that maximize connectivity and impact.
4. **Optimize** connections between isolated residential zones and the existing bike network.

## 4. Technical Approach

Our solution is built on three core modules that process geospatial data, identify target areas, and propose optimized routes.

### Module 1: Urban Feature Extraction

- **Technology:** `OSMnx`
- **Purpose:** Collects and processes neighborhood-level data to quantify existing infrastructure density, extract relevant urban characteristics (e.g., points of interest, street types), and build detailed profiles of the urban area.

### Module 2: Underdeveloped Area Identification

- **Algorithms:** K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN
- **Purpose:** Applies unsupervised machine learning to the urban profiles to identify "bike lane deserts" by detecting mismatches between cycling potential and infrastructure availability.

### Module 3: Infrastructure Proposal

- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Betweenness Centrality Analysis
- **Purpose:** Designs strategic solutions by finding the most efficient routes to connect underserved zones to the existing bike network. Proposals are ranked using a custom impact score based on population served, new POIs connected, and construction feasibility.
